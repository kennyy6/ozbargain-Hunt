A simple script that utilizes telegrams API to send a text to a user of top 20 ozbargains deals of the day. By typing in "/top10" or replying with the item you want to search for

Note that:
   *credentials.py will not be provided dude to privacy, but if you do intend to replicate the code you can replace token with your own api key.
        
        

Things i Would like to do: 
* ~~Implement a Search Function by having a database of some sort that Notifys Users when a specfic product comes to sale.~~   &#x2611; 
* ~~Have specific commands to text the bot.~~ &#x2611;
